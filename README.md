## Why?
I port ROBLOX places to Garry's Mod for a while now, and i've been having issues with my old applications i use.
These tools were spread out by 3 different applications, two of which having no GUI, and only one having VMT generating support.
So, i decided to make this software to help with both decal downloading, decal painting, material printing, and stud printing, all wrapped up
into one neat package.

## Used Libraries
This program uses both [Costura](https://github.com/Fody/Costura) and [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json), both their licenses can be read
on their respective websites.
